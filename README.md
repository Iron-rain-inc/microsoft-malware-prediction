# Microsoft Malware Prediction

## Project Motivation
Microsoft have engaged with data scientists world-wide to develop a model for the purpose of detecting malware vulnerable computers.

Microsoft have provided a dataset as one arm of a strategy to detect malware vulnerabilities.

This project will use the data provided to predict whether a computer is more or less likely vulnerable to a malware attack.
